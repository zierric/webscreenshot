# WebScreenshot
Take a screenshot of any site using golang in 5 seconds using chromedp (Chrome DevTools Protocol), you can adjust the **screenshot size**, the delay before the screenshot and the user agent.

```shell
go run main.go
```

Chrome works in headless mode, and everything works well on a server without a monitor, screenshots are taken in less than 10 seconds.

This is a starting tutorial for those who want to try working with other features of Chrome DevTools Protocol.
